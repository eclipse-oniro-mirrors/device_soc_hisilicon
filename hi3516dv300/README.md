## Introduction<a name="section11660541593"></a>

The  **hispark\_taurus**  repository provides drivers for the Hi3516D V300 chip and provides basic multimedia capabilities for the Multimedia and Graphics subsystems. including audio/video collection, audio/video encoding and decoding, audio/video output, video pre-processing, encapsulation, decapsulation, file management, storage management, and log system. The following figure shows the architecture of the Multimedia subsystem.

## Constraints<a name="section119744591305"></a>

Currently, the Hi3516D V300 chip is supported.

## Compilation and Building<a name="section137768191623"></a>

-   Compiling U-Boot

1.  Download the GCC toolchain from  [https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads). Currently, the toolchain version for compiling U-Boot is  **gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major-linux.tar.bz2**. You can also select other GCC versions.
2.  Copy the GCC toolchain to the  **prebuilts**  directory and decompress it.
3.  Go to the  **hispark\_taurus\\uboot\\out\\boot**  directory and modify the path of the toolchain defined by  **OSDRV\_CROSS**  in the  **makefile**  of the directory.
4.  Run the  **make clean;make all;**  command to compile the U-Boot.

The generated U-Boot is stored in the  **hispark\_taurus\\uboot\\out\\boot**  directory.

Note:  **prebuilts\\mkimage**  is generated by the U-Boot source code.
