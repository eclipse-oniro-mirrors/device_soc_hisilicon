 * <NAME>
 * <FUNCTION DESCRIPTION>
 *    The  wscanf_s  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of the scanf_s function
 *    The wscanf_s function reads data from the standard input stream stdin and
 *    writes the data into the location that's given by argument. Each argument
 *    must be a pointer to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier
 *    in format. If copying occurs between strings that overlap, the behavior is
 *    undefined.
 *
 * <INPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    format                  Format control string.
 *    ...                         Optional arguments.
 *
 * <OUTPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    ...                     the converted value stored in user assigned address
 *
 * <RETURN VALUE>
 *    Returns the number of fields successfully converted and assigned;
 *    the return value does not include fields that were read but not assigned.
 *    A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned.
 *    return -1 if an error occurs.
